That's when I started to code very hard in the beginning didn't know where to start and how to do it but one thing is that I didn't want to go to University for the next 5 years for this. I bought books and also what watching Tutorial videos on Python and Javascript when watching thoses videos I felt like I was not getting anything.

The bootcamp experience was really hard and fast paced but I was really dedicated to learn also was really passionated about coding alot of times I felt overwheled and wanted to give up but I didn't alot of downs getting frustated because my code didn't want to work but at the end I made it thru and graduated from that bootcamp I learned alot from doing project with other people on how to get information on my own, reading documentation which is key for a developer and much much more.
